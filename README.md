# Bank Account Balance Tracker
Application to process credit and debit transactions, track account balances, and publish batched transaction data to downstream audit system with a user interface to display the real-time account balances.

---

## Architecture Overview

The solution is split into three components, each running in its own JVM or process:

1. **Transaction Producer** â€“ generates random credit and debit transactions and sends them to the Balance Tracker API.  
2. **Balance Tracker API** â€“ processes incoming transactions, updates the balance, and batches transactions for submission to the audit system.  
3. **Balance Tracker UI** â€“ a React-based user interface that displays the account balance and periodically refreshes it.  

These components interact via REST APIs.
Transactions flow from the Producer â†’ Balance Tracker API â†’ Audit submission process, while the UI queries the Balance Tracker API to display balances.

## 1. Transaction Producer

### Tech Stack
- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Maven
- Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Spring Actuator (health, metrics)
- RestTemplate for REST communication
- SLF4J with file-based logging for audit traceability  

### Prerequisites
- Java 17  
- Maven 3.9+  

### How it works
The producer generates transactions on two dedicated threads: one for credits and one for debits. Each transaction has a unique transaction ID and an amount between Â£200 and Â£500,000. Debits are represented with negative amounts, credits with positive amounts.  
The producer sends 25 credits and 25 debits per second (50 total) to the Balance Tracker API.

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /api/producer/v1/start` â†’ Starts the producer threads.
- `POST /api/producer/v1/stop` â†’ Stops the producer threads.
- `GET /api/producer/v1/status` â†’ Returns `RUNNING` or `STOPPED`.

### Current Implementation

- Runs as a separate JVM from the Balance Tracker API  
- Spring Boot microservice
- Uses two dedicated threads to continuously generate transactions:  
  - One thread for credits (positive amounts)  
  - One thread for debits (negative amounts)  
- Each transaction includes:  
  - A randomly generated ID (prefixed with CRE or DEB)  
  - A random amount within the configured range  
- Transactions are sent via REST to the Balance Tracker API  
- Retry logic handles transient failures with configurable delay  
- REST endpoints allow lifecycle control (`/start`, `/stop`, `/status`) 
- JUnit with Mockito extension test cases 
- Swagger UI and OpenAPI spec available for all exposed endpoints  
- Actuator endpoints provide health, metrics, and Prometheus integration  

### Production Enhancements

- Replace retry logic with **Resilience4j** (exponential backoff, circuit breaker)  
- Redirect failed transactions to **Kafka/RabbitMQ** or a **DB** for reprocessing  
- Add **Prometheus metrics** for transaction rate, retry count, and batch size    
- Include **OAuth2/JWT authentication and authorization** for REST APIs to control access

## 2. Balance Tracker API

### Tech Stack
- Java 17 
- Spring Boot  
- Maven 
- Springdoc OpenAPI for Swagger documentation 
- Spring Actuator for health and metrics
- H2 Database (for integration testing and local persistence)
- SLF4J with file-based logging for audit traceability

### Prerequisites
- Java 17  
- Maven 3.9+  

### How it works
The Balance Tracker API exposes endpoints to add transactions and retrieve the balance. It maintains the current balance in memory and holds transactions in an in-memory queue. 
Once 1000 transactions have been accumulated, they are batched and submitted to the audit system. Batches are created such that no batch exceeds a total absolute value of Â£1,000,000, and the number of batches is minimized.

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /api/bankaccount/v1/transactions` â†’ Submit a transaction (credit or debit).  
- `GET /api/bankaccount/v1/balance` â†’ Retrieve the current account balance.  

### API Documentation
- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8091/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8091/swagger-ui.html)  
- **OpenAPI spec JSON:** [http://localhost:8091/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8091/v3/api-docs) 
- **OpenAPI spec document:** [balance-tracker-api.yaml](docs/balance-tracker-api.yaml)

### Actuator Endpoints
- Running on port **9091**  
- Health URL: [http://localhost:9091/actuator/health](http://localhost:9091/actuator/health)

- **Audit trigger:** Fires every 30 seconds or when 1000 transactions are accumulated.  
- **Batching logic:** Ensures no batch exceeds Â£1,000,000 in absolute value.  
- **Transaction validation:** Amount range enforced between Â£200 and Â£500,000.  
- **Persistence:** Uses H2 in-memory DB for local testing; replace with PostgreSQL for production.  
- **Actuator:** Exposed on port **9091** for health, metrics, and Prometheus integration.  
- **H2 Console:** Available at `/h2-console` for inspection during development.  
- **Logging:** DEBUG for local traceability; INFO recommended for production.
---
### Current Implementation
- The API exposes endpoints to submit transactions and retrieve the current account balance.  
- Transactions are persisted to an H2 database using Spring Data JPA in a dedicated `TransactionT` entity.  
- The current balance is derived from persisted transactions and stored in a dedicated `BalanceT` entity.  
- Applied **pessimistic locking** to prevent lost updates under concurrent transaction load.
- Once 1000 transactions are accumulated, they are batched and submitted to the audit system.  
- Batches are created such that:
  - No batch exceeds a total absolute value of Â£1,000,000  
  - The number of batches is minimized using a FFD bin-packing strategy  
- Audit submissions are logged to timestamped JSON files under `resources/audit-logs` for traceability.
- Integration tests use H2 to validate persistence, batching, and audit logic.
- JUnit with Mockito extension test cases
- Swagger UI and OpenAPI spec available for all exposed endpoints  
- Actuator endpoints provide health, metrics, and Prometheus integration

## Prototype Implementation
- In-memory storage using `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` and `AtomicReference`  
- Suitable for prototyping or stateless deployments  
- Not recommended for production due to lack of durability

### Production Enhancements
- **Replace in-memory H2 DB** with PostgreSQL or another persistent database for durability.  
- **Pessimistic locking:** `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SET LOCK` to prevent lost updates under concurrent load.  
- **Decouple batching logic:** use Spring Boot Batch or a scheduler to flush incomplete batches.  
- **Decouple transaction processing:** use Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time downstream consumption.  
- **Separate audit tracking table** for balance update history.  
- **Security:** add JWT/OAuth2 for API endpoints.  
- **Horizontal scaling:** run multiple API instances with shared DB or message queue coordination.  
- **Observability:** integrate Prometheus and OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing.

### How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thiruven7/bank-account-balance-tracker.git
cd bank-account-balance-tracker/balance-tracker-api
```
2. **Build the project**:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. **Run the application**:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 3. Balance Tracker UI

### Tech Stack
- ReactJS  
- Axios for API calls  
- Bootstrap (or chosen CSS framework) for styling  

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+  
- npm or yarn  

### How it works
The UI displays a **static Account ID label** and the **current balance**, which is dynamically retrieved from the Balance Tracker API. The balance is refreshed every 3 seconds to provide near real-time updates.  
The UI runs as a standalone React application and calls the `GET /api/bankaccount/v1/balance` endpoint to fetch the latest balance.

### Running the UI
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thiruven7/bank-account-balance-tracker.git
cd balance-tracker-ui
npm install
npm start
```
Default dev server runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  

### Current Implementation
- Simple card-based UI with periodic balance refresh.  
- No authentication.  

### Production Enhancements
- Implement robust error handling and retries for failed API calls.  
- Secure API endpoints using JWT or OAuth2.  
- Extend the UI to include transaction history and audit submission views.  
- Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.
